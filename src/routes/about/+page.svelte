    The Readings are a biannual literary reading seriesâ€”the Spring and Fall
    Reading.
  </p>
  <p class="p-4">
    Each Reading presents three to five writers, their work, and a space for
    everyone to commune on art, culture, and life.
  </p>
  <p class="p-4">
    The Readings are free and informal. Anyone is welcome to read, at any skill
    level, of any form, from any genre. Writers are invited to participate at a
    Reading, it is not an open mic.
  </p>
  <p class="p-4">The program goes like this:</p>
  <ul class="px-6 py-2 list-disc list-inside">
    <li class="py-2">
      The opening party, when people arrive, mingle, meet, munch, talk, and
      laugh.
    </li>
    <li class="py-2">The reading, when the magic happens.</li>
    <li class="py-2">
      The closing party, when people inspire, excite, share, connect, and know
      each other better.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="p-4">We hope to see you soon.</p>
